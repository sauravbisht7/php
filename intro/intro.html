      <h2><u>Introduction to PHP</u></h2>
        <h3>What is PHP?</h3>
        PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a popular server-side scripting language for web development. It is widely used for creating dynamic web pages and web applications.
        <br>
        <h3>Features of PHP</h3>
        Simple and easy to learn. <br>
        Open-source and free.<br>
        Platform-independent.<br>
        Supports various databases.<br>
        Extensive community support.<br>
        <h3> Embedding PHP Code in Web Pages</h3>
       PHP code can be embedded directly into HTML files to create dynamic web pages. PHP scripts are enclosed within special tags, typically <?php for the opening tag and ?> for the closing tag. Here's an example of embedding PHP code to display the current date and time:
        <br>
        html<br>
        head><br>
            <title>Dynamic Web Page</title><br>
        head<br>
        body<br>
            h1>Welcome to our website!h1<br>
            p<br>
                The current date and time is:<br>
                php<br>
                    echo date('Y-m-d H:i:s');<br>
                ?><br>
            p<br>
            p More dynamic content goes here.p><br>
        body<br>
        html<br>
        Output :<br><br>
        <html>
<head>
    <title>Dynamic Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to our website!</h1>
    <p>
        The current date and time is:
        <?php
            echo date('Y-m-d H:i:s');
        ?>
    </p>
    <p>More dynamic content goes here.</p>
</body>
</html> <br><br>
        
        
        In the example above, the PHP code between the <?php and ?> tags is used to generate and display the current date and time. When the page is loaded in a web browser, the PHP code is executed on the server, and the result is sent to the client's browser as part of the HTML response.
        <br>
        Printing in PHP<br>
        You can print in PHP whose syntax is like this: echo "Hello, PHP!";<br>
        
        Here's an example of a simple PHP script that displays a message:<br>
        
        <?php<br>
        $message = "Hello, PHP!";<br>
        echo $message;<br>
        ?><br>
        Output :<br>
