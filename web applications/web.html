   <h2><u>Web Applications</u></h2> 
<h4>1)Web applications are software programs that run on web servers and are accessed by users over the internet through a web browser. 
    They dynamically generate web pages and content instead of serving static HTML files. <br> This allows for more interactive and customizable experiences.<br><br>
    2)Common examples include web-based email, social media sites, shopping carts, banking portals, wikis, blogs, online games, and countless other apps powered by the web.<br><br>
    3)Web apps handle user input through web page forms, clicks, and other actions that get sent to the server. The server processes the requests and returns new page content.<br><br>
    4)Web apps involve web development using languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript on the front-end and languages like PHP, Python, Java, .NET on the back-end.<br><br>
    5)Typical web app architecture has a client-server model with a front-end UI, back-end database/logic, and HTTP protocol for communication.<br><br>
    6)Web apps can range from simple static sites to complex single-page apps that rely heavily on asynchronous communication and dynamic updating.<br><br>
    7)Common challenges in web app development include state management, real-time synchronization, security, and optimizing performance.<br><br>
    8)Popular frameworks like React, Angular, Django, Rails provide structures to help build and deploy robust web apps efficiently.<br><br>
    9)Web apps are ubiquitous due to cross-platform accessibility, efficient delivery over HTTP, and ability to update codebase centrally on the server.<br><br></h4>

   <h3> -Benefits of Web Applications</h3>
.Platform-independent access via a web browser. <br>
.Easy maintenance and updates, as changes are made on the server side. <br>
.Global accessibility, allowing users to access applications from anywhere. <br>
.Centralized data storage and management. <br> <br>
<h3>-Limitations of Web Applications</h3>
.Dependent on internet connectivity. <br>
.Potential security vulnerabilities if not properly secured. <br>
.Performance may be affected by server load and network congestion. <br>
.Compatibility issues across different web browsers. <br> <br>
<h3>-Scripting</h3>
<h4>.Client-Side Scripting :</h4>
Runs in the web browser on the user's device, not on the web server. <br>
Typically uses JavaScript to dynamically manipulate DOM, handle user, validate input, update UI, etc. <br>
Can improve performance by avoiding unnecessary server requests. <br>
But cannot directly access server resources like databases <br>

<h4>.Server-Side Scripting :</h4>
Runs on the web server before page is sent to the user's browser. <br>
Common languages include PHP, Python, Ruby, ASP.NET. Can access databases, file systems, external APIs on the server. <br>
Dynamically generates HTML, CSS, JavaScript sent to client. <br>
Handles core application logic, computations, security. <br>
Enables dynamic, database-driven web applications. <br> <br> <br>
<h3>-Web Servers</h3>
Web applications can run on both local and remote web servers: <br>

<h4>Local Web Server:</h4> Used for development and testing on a local machine (e.g., XAMPP, WampServer). <br>
<h4>Remote Web Server:</h4> Hosts web applications on the internet, making them accessible globally. <br>
<br> <br>
<h3>-Static and Dynamic Websites</h3>
Web applications can be categorized as static or dynamic: <br>

<h4>Static and Dynamic Websites</h4> Content remains the same for all users. HTML and CSS are used for presentation. <br>
<h4>Dynamic Websites:</h4> Content changes based on user interactions and data from databases. PHP, along with other server-side technologies, enables dynamic web applications.
<br> <br> <br><h3>Conclusion</h3> <br>
Web applications powered by PHP offer numerous benefits, such as global accessibility and easy maintenance, while also presenting challenges like security and performance considerations. Understanding client-side and server-side scripting, web server options, and the difference between static and dynamic websites is crucial for building successful web applications.
