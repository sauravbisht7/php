    <h2><u>PHP Basics</u></h2>
<h2>Tokens</h2>
PHP code consists of various tokens, including keywords, identifiers, constants, strings, and operators.<br />
These tokens are the building blocks of PHP scripts.
<br /><br />
<h2><br>Variables</b></h2>
Variables in PHP are used to store data. They start with a dollar sign ($) followed by an identifier. PHP variables are case-sensitive.
<br><br>
$variable_name = "Hello, PHP!";<br><br>
<h2>Scope of Variables</h2><br>
PHP variables have different scopes:<br>

<h3>1)Local scope:</h3> Variables declared within a function.<br>
<h3>2)Global scope:</h3> Variables declared outside functions.<br>
<h3>3)Static scope:</h3> Variables within a function that retain their values between function calls.<br><br><br>
<h2>constants</h2><br>
Constants are used to store values that cannot be changed. They are defined using the define() function.<br>

define("PI", 3.14159);<br><br>
<h2>operator</h2><br>
PHP supports various operators, including arithmetic, assignment, comparison, logical, and more.<br>

$x = 10;<br>
$y = 5;<br>
$sum = $x + $y; // Addition operator<br><br>
<h2>data types</h2><br>
In PHP, data types specify the type of data that can be stored in a variable. PHP supports several data types, each designed for handling specific types of information. Here are some of the most common data types in PHP:
<br>
<h3>integer</h3> Integer data type represents whole numbers. <br>Example:<br>
$age = 30;<br>
<h3>Float</h3> Float data type, also known as floating-point or double, represents numbers with decimal points. Example:<br>
$price = 19.99;<br>
<h3>String</h3> String data type represents sequences of characters, such as text. Example:<br>
$name = "John";<br>
<h3>array</h3>Array data type is used to store collections of values, such as lists or associative arrays. Example:<br>
$fruits = array("apple", "banana", "cherry");<br>
<h3>object</h3> Object data type is used to create custom data structures and classes.<br> Example:<br>
class Person {<br>
    public $name;<br>
    public $age;<br>
}<br>

$person = new Person();<br>
$person->name = "Alice";<br>
$person->age = 25;<br>
<h3>Boolean</h3> Boolean data type represents true or false values. <br>Example:<br>
$flag = true;<br>
Understanding and correctly using data types in PHP is essential for effective programming and data manipulation in your web applications.
<br>
<h3>Number Handling</h3><br>
PHP provides functions for number handling, such as intval() and floatval() for converting between data types.<br>

$number = "123";<br>
$int_number = intval($number); // Convert to integer<br>
<h3>Comments</h3>
Comments in PHP can be used to explain code and are not executed. Single-line comments start with //, and multi-line comments are enclosed in /* */.
<br>
// This is a single-line comment<br>

/*<br>
    This is a multi-line comment<br>
    It can span multiple lines<br>
*/<br>
<h3>Echo and Print Statements</h3>
PHP uses echo and print statements to output data to the browser.<br>

$name = "Duniya";<br>
echo "Namaste " . $name;<br><br>
Output :<br>
Namaste Duniya<br><br>


<h3>Conclusion</h3>
This webpage has provided an overview of essential PHP basics, including tokens, variables, scope of variables, constants, operators, data types, <br>number handling, comments, and the use of echo and print statements.Understanding these fundamental concepts is crucial for building dynamic <br>and interactive web applications with PHP. As you continue your PHP journey, you'll explore more advanced topics and gain proficiency in web development.
